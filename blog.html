<h4>The coronavirus pandemic has made people more health conscious than before.</h4>
   
  <p style="text-align:left;">
 With social distancing becoming the new norm, people have turned to digital wellness platforms to keep fit and stay healthy. In this scenario, digital wellness startup HealthifyMe, offering coaching and AI-based nutrition plans to customers, has seen a rise in revenues and paying customers in the past few months. To cater to the increasing demand, HealthifyMe is effectively leveraging its in-house artificial intelligence (AI) platform to provide services for a much lesser price, along with a personalised touch.</p><p>
Founded in 2012, HealthifyMe is backed by VCs like Chiratae Ventures and Inventus Capital. The startup claims to have more than doubled its paying subscriber base to one lakh plus since April this year, while the app download has crossed 16 million. The startup is now looking to cross an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $20 million (Rs 148 crore approximately) by January 2021. It already crossed $15 million (Rs 111 crore approximately) in August this year. HealthifyMe has also been operationally profitable since April this year with positive contribution margins. The startup has also reduced its burn rate by more than half in the last six months.</p><p>
The key engine which is powering the growth of HealthifyMe is its AI platform Ria.There has been several positives for HealthifyMe with it. It has been able to provide immediate feedback, perform multiple tasks at the same time, and also act as a motivation or reminder tool for the users.Tushar Vashishth, co-founder and CEO, says, “In the last 18 months, our paying customers have grown by around 5x and most of this is because of our AI engine.”
Talking about future prospects, Tushar says, “This is the best time. We have an AI plan that can scale. We have a product market fit that works and people today are more health consciousness.”</p>

                          <h4>The hospitality, travel, and tourism industry has taken the worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak,</h4>
                              <p style="text-align:left;">
with global and domestic travel coming to a near-halt. 
As a consequence, OYO Hotels and Homes - one of the world's biggest hospitality brands by 10 lacs+ rooms in over 80 countries toplined around 6k crore, has suffered drastically. Founder & CEO Ritesh Agarwal said his company has taken a hit of 50-60 percent in its global revenue and occupancy. The drop is even higher in India on account of the coronavirus-induced lockdown whose impact will extend for the coming months as well. Small hotel owners have only a few months of cash left. OYO announced its global restructuring plan in January 2020. 
Between the period of  January and March, OYO cut 5,000 jobs mainly in China and India, leaving it with about 25,000 employees, and amended contracts with hotels to remove revenue guarantees. OYO Hotels and Homes also announced a minimum of 25 percent pay cut for four months starting April. Ritesh Agarwal has himself taken a 100 percent pay cut. In order to keep the company afloat and secure long-term cash runaway, the company sent a significant number of its workforce on leave or furloughs for a minimum of 90 days with limited healthcare and medicare benefits.</p><p>
Mr. Agarwal confidently speaks about seeing the company along with its partners, through these tough times and emerging more stronger than ever. Oyo recognizes that the hospitality industry will undergo major change post-crisis. It aspires to provide accordingly to consumer preferences, with health and safety occupying top priorities. Sanitisation and quality service would be a critical requirement. Post-COVID crisis, inculcating technology, and optimal operations in their operation would be a necessary industrial requirement. Oyo has significantly improved in its feedback on policy and reconciliation. OYOpreneurs are seeking more support and fee rebates to invest in the sanitization stage during the unlock period. OYO aims to focus on consumer experience and feedback right from the immediate check-in to the posted checkout, ensuring their sense of safety and comfort. All forms of social distancing, sanitization, touchless check-in, and digital payment will be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>Oyo seems determined to come back stronger post-crisis, laced with all the necessary technical and safety requirements and innovations, lifting back its revenue, and providing standardized quality services to its customers across the globe.</p>
